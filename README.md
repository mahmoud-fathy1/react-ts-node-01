# Fullstack Application

This project demonstrates a fullstack setup using modern web development tools and libraries for building responsive frontend user interfaces and a lightweight backend API. The frontend showcases form handling, styled components, and UI animations, while the backend handles basic API logic and email communication.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React** (v18) for building dynamic and interactive UIs
- **TypeScript** for static typing and improved developer experience
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Material Tailwind** for styled React components
- **Formik** for managing and validating forms
- **Yup** for form validation schema
- **React Router DOM** for client-side routing
- **React Slick** and **Slick Carousel** for interactive carousels
- **React Feather** and **Heroicons** for modern SVG icons
- **React Scroll** and **Hash Link** for smooth scrolling behavior

### Backend

- **Node.js** with **Express** for building a lightweight REST API
- **Nodemailer** for handling email sending via backend
- **CORS** to enable secure cross-origin requests
- **Nodemon** for automatic backend reload during development

## 🌐 Features Demonstrated

- **Responsive UI**: Built with Tailwind and Material Tailwind
- **Form Handling**: Forms handled with Formik and validated via Yup
- **Routing & Navigation**: Smooth navigation with scroll behavior
- **Interactive Elements**: Carousels and scroll animations
- **Email Functionality**: Backend handles form submissions with email integration
- **API Integration**: Frontend connects with backend using HTTP requests

## 🚀 Development & Deployment

- Uses **Vite** for rapid development and fast builds
- Frontend and backend can run independently or together
- Backend runs with **Nodemon** for auto-reloading
- Deployment can be done via any platform (e.g., GitHub Pages for frontend, Vercel/Render for backend)
